## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shae! Iâ€™m a former Product Leader with 8 years of experience in mobile and web apps, now pivoting into full-stack software engineering.
With a background in product management and data analysis, I bring the same curiosity and data-driven mindset when approaching both frontend and backend development. I enjoy designing efficient database structures, building secure authentication, and creating robust APIs.
