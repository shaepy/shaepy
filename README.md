## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shae! Iâ€™m a former Product Leader with 8 years of experience in mobile and web apps, now pivoting into full-stack software engineering.
With a background in product management and data analysis, I bring the same curiosity and data-driven mindset when approaching both frontend and backend development. I enjoy designing efficient database structures, building secure authentication, and creating robust APIs.

### ðŸ“Œ Pinned Projects
#### [Moneymoo](https://github.com/shaepy/moneymoo)
My favorite project is my stock portfolio management tool, **[moneymoo](https://github.com/shaepy/moneymoo)**, built with the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js and EJS) and real-time market data APIs. It enables users to log trades, track unrealized gains/losses, search and browse trending stocks, and manage personalized watchlists â€” combining backend data modeling with user-friendly portfolio insights.

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) app for managing studio classes and bookings. It supports secure role-based access for owners, instructors, and students, enabling features like session scheduling, student reservations, and instructor management. The platform streamlines class organization and improves the booking experience for both staff and students.
