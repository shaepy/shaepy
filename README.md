## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shae! Iâ€™m a former Product Leader with 8 years of experience in mobile and web apps, now pivoting into full-stack software engineering.

My favorite project is my stock portfolio management tool, **moneymoo**, that lets users log trades, track unrealized gains/losses, search and browse trending stocks, and monitor watchlists with real-time market data APIs.

I especially enjoy backend development and designing efficient database structures, as well as building secure authentication, and creating robust APIs. With a background in product management and data analysis, I bring the same curiosity and data-driven mindset when approaching both frontend and backend development.
